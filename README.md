# watermelon-scorer
funny idea about watermelons quality
the idea is that to know is it red in watermelon or white?
in our country people do this by sound of tapping on watermelon but not everyone have ability to do that
we can take picture of watermelon and predict the color using CNN
it can be classes for example white/near to white/midium/near to red/red
implement of that is so easy by making dataset of that this way
1.take picture of watermelon
2.label that after cutting watermelon
one thing that is amazing is that in other ml models human can do sth then model learn from human
but in this case human cant do that(with picture of watermelon that it didnt cut)but model can do that!
